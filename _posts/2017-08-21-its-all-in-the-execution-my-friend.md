# It's all in the execution my friend...

It has been explored before. It is not something new and unique. The idea is however still appealing and remains a reality somewhat not yet fulfilled. 

What lacks is the execution. Or rather, the excellent and elegant execution.

Let me start with the underlying premise of a promise that has never really been realized. That is the promise of a no-headache-development-department for a low cost.

You got the development department for a low cost. The headache didn't disappear though. And it maybe wasn't that cheap either once the project was finished and all things had been said and done.

Human nature remains the same. It doesn't really change how much you'd like it to.

Headaches:

* Hiring skilled developers / Quality of output
* Managing projects / being on top of the project / transparency
* Values:

* Consistency
* Reliability
* Scalability
* Transparency
* Quality of output _and _**process**

Perhaps we can all agree on that outsourcing development is not something that is easily accomplished. At least if you care about the outcome. Finding the right consultant (most options are heavily tilted towards providing individual talent and it is not really scalable or repeatable).

I've worked almost two decades as a consultant and developer and outsourcing has always popped up as the "holy grail" of management nirvana. Much to the dismay of the developers on the team that had to deal with day-to-day cultural differences and the so called "knowledge transfer" needed.

To embark on the outsourcing and offshoring journey you need a completely new set of skills as a manager. Developers on the team also needs to develop a different mindset to deal with cultural differences and be able to learn to delegate work more efficiently. It takes real management skills to pull this off. In a sense you drive the problems related to development upwards in the organisation towards management level. This is not necessarily a bad thing - but as said before it requires a different skillset.

Previously if you had skilled developers on your team they would typically see the complete picture of the company and the larger goals. With offshoring and outsourcing development becomes a mere commodity. It is fine for certain things but it is catastrophical for a larger set of problems that require cross-department communication to develop functional and creative solutions to hard business problems. 

Once the project is done there is no real guarantee that the hard-earned-ip-knowledge of the project remains in the company as it might be tied very heavily to a certain individual or group of individual. Ideally you would want a place to "hibernate" your project until it needs to be updated or iterated upon. It could be years from now and what guarantees do you actually have that the company somewhere on the other side of the globe will still be around and yet still remember what the last state of the project was and pick up the ball where it was left (or very close by anyway).

For a true development-as-a-service to function we need a way to let a project lie dormant for amount of time and then to be reactivated whenever needed. It should also be very easy to scale the work both ways. And the quality of the work should not suffer because you only allocate a few hours a month to the project.

Traditionally consulting businesses prioritize and prefer long contract assignments for individual consultants. Because that means less selling efforts and fewer hours in between assignments and thus a higher profit for the agency. This might be short term good for both the agency and the client but long term it kind of sucks. Both because the agency is mainly disconnected from the client for the duration of the contract - little to no communication is needed unless there is a problem with the consultant or something else pops up. The relationship with the client is mostly up to the consultant to maintain and develop, not the agency and the client gets a relationship with the individual and not with the company.

Fast forward a bit into the future and the contract ends because the job is done; the agency will do all in it's power to find another assignment for this consultant and the relationship with the client and the project is more or less discontinued or at least put on hold until further notice. If the client ever wishes to resume the work or start up another project they probably wouldn't have the same consultant available as an option which is kind of sad because now their entire experience is different. Certain expectations has been set with the first relationship and they might not be fulfilled the second time around.

Fast forward a bit into the future and some has been fortunate enough to find the right match of off-shore labour for their development needs but far more companies has failed their outsourcing strategies the way the initially set out to implement them. If they adapted to the reality of outsourcing it sure gave them a boost in productivity with reduced cost. However it came with it's own set of challenges. Such as cultural differences. How to manage a remote team and make sure enough work was available to utilize the hired workforce.

Agencies with local presence started to appear and provided agents to handle the cultural differences and provide a layer of
