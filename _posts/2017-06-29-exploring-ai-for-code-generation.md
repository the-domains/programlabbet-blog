# Exploring AI for code generation

I've been toying around with this pet/passion project for a while. Lately it seems like it is becoming a lot more feasible and within grasp in at least 5-7 years time. Approximately.

It's already now possible to achieve parts of artificially generated code that are fairly complex. The main obstacle is the verification/validation loop. It needs to get really fast and be extremely explicit about things we care about. Such as actual outcome, memory usage, speed and such things. If/when we optimise for those parameters it becomes a matter of searching the solution space for the optimal code.

A new platform to build upon that is extremely suitable for this project has also emerged from the front lines of web development of all places. I'm talking about [http://webassembly.org][0]

It is actually a perfect match to run the AI coding brain on.
